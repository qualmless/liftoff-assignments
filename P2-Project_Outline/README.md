### Overview
Include overview here

I would like to create either an app or a more functional working version of the sisterlocks.com website. The current site is incredibly difficult to navigate, poorly designed, and I believe updated infrequently. I know that i had a difficult time navigating when i started my hair journey, and i'm technologically savvy, so i can imagine how others might have felt. 
I believe the stylists' entries are hardcoded, and i think they'd work better in a larger database. It would also be a lot easier to search by location if the entries were organized by zip and then fed through whatever functionality the demo project uses to sort by location. 
I would like to have the stylists submit to have their entries added, but have them approved first either manually or automatically depending on how they were added. Also have entries able to be updated as their continued training or moving of location may require.
